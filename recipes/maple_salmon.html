    <p>This maple glazed salmon is delicious and very easy to prepare. I love maple syrup in everything and decided to use it in the marinade. My husband totally loved it; he wasn't a salmon fan until now.</p>

    </ul>
    <ol><h4>Steps: </h4>
        <li>Stir maple syrup, soy sauce, garlic, garlic salt, and pepper together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Cut salmon into 4 equal-sized fillets; place in a shallow glass baking dish and coat with maple syrup mixture. Cover the dish and marinate salmon in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, turning once halfway.</li>
